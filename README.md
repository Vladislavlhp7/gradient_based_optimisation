# COMP36212 Gradient-Based Optimisation
ANN optimization for image classification on MNIST dataset.
## Problem Statement
In this assignment we explore the optimisation methods of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for image classification. The task is to train a multi-layer perceptron, applied to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset (Lecun et al., 1998), aiming to achieve maximum classification accuracy. The process involves the computation of a prediction from a sample input (i.e., an image), the comparison of the network prediction with the true label to formulate an objective function for optimisation (cross-entropy loss), and the use of target optimisation approaches to minimise the objective function with respect to the network parameters.
